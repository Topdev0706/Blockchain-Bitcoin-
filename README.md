# qfactom
kdb+ library designed to interact with the factomd client API and factom-walletd API.

Library enables
* Transactions: Both factoid->factoid and factoid->entry credit
* Chain creation: Create and commit to a factom chain
* Utilities: Check balances, block-height, transaction lookups

Combining the speed of kdb+ with the scalability and security of factom enables
millions of records to be secured quickly and safely on the blockchain.

Use cases:

* Securing large data sets. For example, IoT data
* Securing private blockchains through the use of anchoring
* Providing a proof of receipt mechanism
* Making data public - Publication of clear text data. For example, stock market prices https://explorer.factom.org/chain/0464bf13a66ed62d8196c51292caedaecbd8dfe245acdbd1aafdac9ed9d77b1b
* Acting as a smart contract oracle.
