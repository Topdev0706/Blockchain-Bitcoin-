# qfactom
kdb+ API library designed to interact with the Factom blockchain via 
the factomd client REST API and factom wallet REST API. For install and usage instructions see [wiki](https://github.com/jlucid/qfactom/wiki) pages.
Combining the speed of kdb+ with the scalability and security of factom enables
millions of records to be secured quickly and safely on the Bitcoin blockchain.

Library enables
* Transactions: Both factoid->factoid and factoid->entry credit
* Chain creation: Create chains and make entries to those chains
* Chain extraction: Extract all chain entries given a chain id 
* Receipts: Extract cryptographic proof that chain entries are secured with a single hash on the Bitcoin blockchain
* Utilities: Check balances, block-height, transaction lookups

Use cases:

* Securing large data sets. For example, IoT data.
See https://www.ethnews.com/factom-receives-second-dhs-grant-for-blockchain-iot-project

* Securing private blockchains through the use of anchoring.
See http://bitfury.com/content/5-white-papers-research/bitfury_white_paper_on_blockchain_auditability.pdf

* Providing a proof of existence.
Anchor hashes in the bitcoin blockchain can provide undisputable cryptographic proof that data was 
at a particular state at a given point in time. 

* Providing an open ledger for public data.
Intrinio use the Factom blockchain to publish stock market prices every 15 minutes for 3000 US stocks.

Entry records are easily accessible via the Factom blockchain explorer. See

* Acting as a smart contract oracle. In this scenario, a smart contract (running on a decentralized network
  such as RSK or ethereum) can use the factom blockchain to extract reliable/verifiable data.
