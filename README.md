# qfactom
kdb+ API library designed to interact with the Factom blockchain via 
the factomd client REST API and factom wallet REST API. For install and usage instructions see [wiki](https://github.com/jlucid/qfactom/wiki) pages.
Combining the speed of kdb+ with the scalability and security of factom enables
millions of records to be secured quickly and safely on the Bitcoin blockchain.

## Functionality
* Transactions: Both factoid->factoid and factoid->entry credit
* Chain creation: Create chains and make entries to those chains
* Chain extraction: Extract all chain entries given a chain id 
* Receipts: Extract cryptographic proof that chain entries are secured with a single hash on the Bitcoin blockchain
* Utilities: Check balances, block-height, transaction lookups

## Use cases

* Securing large IOT data sets. 
See [Blockchain IOT Project](https://www.ethnews.com/factom-receives-second-dhs-grant-for-blockchain-iot-project)
* Securing private blockchains through the use of anchoring.
See [Blockchain Auditing](http://bitfury.com/content/5-white-papers-research/bitfury_white_paper_on_blockchain_auditability.pdf)
* Providing a proof of existence.
Anchor hashes in the bitcoin blockchain can provide indisputable cryptographic proof that data was 
at a particular state at a given point in time. 
See [PoE Explained](http://www.newsbtc.com/proof-of-existence/)
* Providing an open ledger for public data.
Intrinio use the Factom blockchain to publish stock market prices every 15 minutes for 3000 US stocks. 
See [Intrinio Article](https://www.factom.com/blog/intrinio-factom-announce-collaboration).
Entry records are easily accessible via the Factom blockchain explorer.

* Acting as a smart contract oracle. In this scenario, a smart contract (running on a decentralized network
  such as RSK or ethereum) can use the factom blockchain to extract reliable/verifiable data.

## Prerequisites

* kdb+ v3.4 or higher
* [qutil](https://github.com/nugend/qutil) - Required if you wish to load the library using qutil.
  If not, an alternative method is provided. See below.
* A factomd client and wallet application for the library to communicate with.  

## Installing

To load using qutil, follow the steps below.

Create a link named "qfactom" in the QPATH directory which points to qfactom/lib. This will enable qutil to find the init.q file and load the library
Start a q session and load using the following command

    q).utl.require "qfactom"
    q)key `
    `q`Q`h`j`o`util`factomd`factomwallet    // .factomd and .factomwallet namespace loaded
    
Alternatively, the library can be loaded using the provided factomLoad.q script.
First set the environmental variable 
QFACTOM_HOME to where you placed the qfactom folder locally.
    $export QFACTOM_HOME=/home/test/library/qfactom/
    $q $QFACTOM_HOME/lib/factomLoad.q
